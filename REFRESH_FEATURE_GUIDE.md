# Manual Source Refresh Feature

## 🔄 **New Refresh Feature Overview**

I've successfully added a manual refresh button for each news source, allowing you to trigger immediate scans for debugging and testing purposes.

### ✨ **Features Added:**

#### 1. **Refresh Button for Each Source**
- **🟢 Green "Refresh" button** next to Edit/Delete buttons
- **Instant scanning** of that specific source
- **Real-time feedback** with progress indicators

#### 2. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Last Activity tracking** showing both manual and automatic scans
- **Loading states** with spinning icons during refresh
- **Multiple toast notifications** for different states

#### 3. **Comprehensive Feedback System**
- **Progress toast**: Shows when refresh is starting
- **Results toast**: Displays scan results with success/failure rates
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages if refresh fails
- **Auto-reload**: Page refreshes after successful scan to show updated counts

### 🛠️ **How to Use:**

#### **Manual Refresh Process:**
1. **Navigate** to `/sources` page
2. **Click** the green "🔄 Refresh" button for any source
3. **Watch** the progress indicators:
   - Button shows "Refreshing..." with spinning icon
   - Toast notification appears with progress
4. **View results** in the results toast:
   - Success rate and article counts
   - Failure breakdown if applicable
5. **Page auto-reloads** to show updated article counts

#### **What Happens During Refresh:**
```javascript
🔄 Manual refresh triggered for source: Reuters Top News
🔍 Processing article 1/30: https://www.reuters.com/world/...
📡 HTTP Response: 200 OK for https://www.reuters.com/world/...
✅ Successfully extracted content from: https://www.reuters.com/world/...
📊 Scan Results for https://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews:
   ✅ Success: 28/30 (93%)
   ❌ Failed: 2/30 (7%)
✅ Manual refresh completed for Reuters Top News: 28/30 articles processed
```

### 📊 **Enhanced Tracking:**

#### **Last Activity Column:**
- **Manual**: Shows when you last manually refreshed
- **Auto**: Shows when the automatic cron job last scanned
- **Never scanned**: For new sources that haven't been processed yet

Example display:
```
Manual: 9/29/2025
Auto: 9/28/2025
```

### 🎯 **Perfect for Debugging:**

#### **Immediate Testing:**
- Test new sources instantly without waiting for cron
- Verify RSS feed validity immediately
- See real-time success/failure rates
- Get detailed error diagnostics

#### **Enhanced Logging Integration:**
- Works with the enhanced logging system
- Shows detailed failure breakdowns
- Provides actionable insights
- Detects bot blocking, rate limiting, etc.

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Backend Route:**
```javascript
POST /sources/refresh/:id
```

#### **Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "scanned": 28,

    "failed": 2,
    "source": "Reuters Top News",
    "url": "https://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews"

#### **Frontend Features:**
